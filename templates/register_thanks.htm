<h1>Thanks for registering</h1>
<p>We're looking forward to seeing you! If you know any more SSSians, consider sending them <a href="{{ url_for('index') }}">this website link</a> so that they can attend, too.</p>
<p>
  <div class="a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 a2a_default_style" style="display: inline-block;" data-a2a-url="http://2016meet.sic.sssnet.tk" data-a2a-title="SSS Meetup 2016">
    <a class="a2a_button_email"></a><a class="a2a_button_google_plus"></a><a class="a2a_button_facebook"></a><a class="a2a_button_twitter"></a><a class="a2a_button_whatsapp"></a>
  </div>
</p>
<p>Before you come, here are a few things to keep in mind:
  <ul>
    <li>You will have to bring/organise <b>your own lunch</b> (if you are coming for lunch, that is).</li>
    <li>Water can be provided, but it'll help if you bring along a <b>water-bottle</b> as well.</li>
    <li>Some <b>stationery</b> will be provided for those who feel inspired to start making products on the spot. However, if you plan to do a lot of work, then please bring your own stationery if possible.</li>
    <li>Afte the presentations, the stage will be open for 10-minute <b>ad-sessions</b>, where any shops who want can come up on stage and advertise their products. If you plan to do this, you may want to rehearse for it first (you don't have to, though).</li>
  </ul>
<b>We look forward to seeing you very soon!</b>
